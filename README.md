# Quickstart tutorials IBC SDK

This code supports the tutorials found at [the IBC SDK docs](https://developers.openibc.com/docs/quickstart/).

Usage:
- check if there is an artifacts folder that already contains the required artifacts for deployment
- in case of some Hardhat projects, you'll have to run `npm install` before being able to compile contracts with `npx hardhat compile`
